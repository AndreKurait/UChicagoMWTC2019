"""
Any attempt at using inspection/meta programming to access the ground truth
data will be met with the most severe penalty.

We will obfuscate the testing environment to make it impossible.
This test class is functionally equivalent, but much less sophisticated to the
actual testing kit we use. It is kept simple to make your life easy, and to
prevent you from having too much knowledge that might be otherwise inviting.

Make sure the simulation finishes within 4 hours.
